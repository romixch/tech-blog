    <h1>About me</h1>

      development I find interesting for me and probably others.

      I started as a Java developer. But things changed a lot in the last 15 years. Today I use a lot of JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin and other languages.
      I even come across some perl and bash somethimes.
